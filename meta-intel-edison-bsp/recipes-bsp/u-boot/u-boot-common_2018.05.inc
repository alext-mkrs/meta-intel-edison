SUMMARY = "U-Boot is both a first-stage and second-stage bootloader. It is loaded by the system's \
ROM or BIOS from a supported boot device, such as an SD card, SATA drive, NOR flash (e.g. using SPI \
or IÂ²C), or NAND flash. \
\
U-Boot runs a command-line interface on a serial port. Using the console, users can load and boot a \
kernel, possibly changing parameters from the default. There are also commands to read device information, \
read and write flash memory, download files (kernels, boot images, etc.) from the serial port or network, \
manipulate device trees, and work with environment variables (which can be written to persistent storage, \
and are used to control U-Boot behavior such as the default boot command and timeout before auto-booting, \
as well as hardware data such as the Ethernet MAC address)."
